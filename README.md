# Machine-Learning
Machine learning (ML) is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that allows software applications to become more accurate at predicting outcomes without being explicitly programmed to do so.

There are two types of learning:
1) Supervised: It helps predict labelled data. Here, we have the input and output based on which we train our model to achieve some level of accuracy. eg: Linear Regression, SVM
2) Unsupervised: Here, we have the input data but no output during training. The algorithms finds similarities in the data. eg: K-means, Apriori, Hierarchical Clustering, etc.
