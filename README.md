# Machine-Learning
Machine learning (ML) is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that allows software applications to become more accurate at predicting outcomes without being explicitly programmed to do so.

There are two types of learning:
1) Supervised: It helps predict labelled data. Here, we have the input and output based on which we train our model to achieve some level of accuracy. eg: Linear Regression, SVM
2) Unsupervised: Here, we have the input data but no output during training. The algorithms finds similarities in the data. eg: K-means, Apriori, Hierarchical Clustering, etc.

This repository includes different Machine Learning Algorithms:
# Linear Regression
It is a supervised learning algorithm which investigates the relationship between a dependent and independent variables. It is modelled using a straight line used to predict the value of a variable based on the value of another variable. The variable you want to predict is called the dependent variable. The variable you are using to predict the other variable's value is called the independent variable.
The linear regression is done on the headbrain dataset taken from Kaggle.
